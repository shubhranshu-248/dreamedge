  {
    q: "Which classes does Dream Edge cover?",
    a: "Classes 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 — CBSE and State Board — across Maths, Science, Social Science, and English. We start with Maths and roll out other subjects course by course.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is this live classes or recorded lessons?",
    a: "Both. Scheduled live classes run through our in-app player, and every live class is edited and uploaded as a 'rewatch' within 3–4 hours, so you can revise any topic later. Full test series + notes are included.",
  },
  {
    q: "How are the courses different from YouTube?",
    a: "The lessons are built around a concept-first system (the same one Dream IIT Institute has used for 5,000+ students), there's a structured syllabus with tests, you can ask doubts, and your progress is tracked. YouTube videos are great for one-off topics; this is a full coaching program.",
  },
  {
    q: "What devices can I use?",
    a: "The Dream Edge website works on any modern browser (phone, laptop, tablet). The Android app will be on Play Store at launch. iOS app follows in Phase 2.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I get a refund if I don't like the course?",
    a: "Yes — a full refund within 7 days of purchase as long as you've consumed less than 20% of the course content. Full policy on the Refund Policy page.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who teaches on Dream Edge?",
    a: "Rahul Sir (IIT Dhanbad, 8+ years teaching) leads mentoring, with support from the Dream IIT Institute teaching team. Every teacher is vetted on both subject expertise and ability to explain to a 12-year-old.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I pay? Is it safe?",
    a: "Payments go through Razorpay (UPI, cards, net banking, wallets). We don't see or store your card number or UPI PIN. Every purchase gets an invoice emailed to you.",
  },
  {
    q: "I have more questions.",
    a: "Email support@dreamedge.online or use the contact form. We respond within one working day.",
